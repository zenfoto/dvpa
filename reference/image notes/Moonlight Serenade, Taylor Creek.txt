Field Notes (from 1997)
This image was made during a fall workshop in Zion National Park. We had hiked one of the “finger” canyons of the Kolob area in the remote northern section of the Park. If you have never visited this section of the park you’ve missed a tremendous opportunity for privacy and solitude.

As we hiked out of the canyon the crescent moon revealed itself over the ridge of one of the towering canyon walls. Several of the participants stopped to make an image of the moon nestled between the arched branches of some old cottonwood trees. The image didn’t fit my mood so I sat down to simply soak in the last few minutes before darkness.

The moon was descending quickly with the sun and was nearing the crest line of the canyon ridge. I noticed there was also a thin veil of clouds gaining a purplish hue creating a soft velvet texture to the sky. Looking more closely at the rock and tree formations on the ridge I felt the rising excitement of an image forming in my mind. I composed several times settling on the final composition that balanced the highest rock against the position of the moon.

I had little time to gauge exposure so bracketed around the exposure my camera suggested. I was very pleased with the results especially the soft ring of light created by the moonlight and the thin layer of clouds.
