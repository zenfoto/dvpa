      "heading": "The Why",
      "text": "I strive to convey fleeting moments that resonate as guides to my own life — subtlety, simplicity, the sublime. The canvas of my inspiration is the American West, its broad brush strokes of wilderness and agriculture. I value intimacy of place, returning frequently to locations where time and communion have deepened my understanding of both place and self."

      "heading": "The Discipline",
      "text": "I've disciplined myself to explore without the weight (both physical and psychological) of a camera. The ability to see photographs is a mysterious balance of curiosity, receptivity, and experience. The acuteness of my receptivity, a discipline in letting go of preconceptions, can be elusive and frustrating. The process is a meditation, a 'non-effort' in becoming fully present and aware of the surroundings."

      "heading": "In the Field",
      "text": "When inspiration is found, it necessitates careful consideration of subject and light. Returning, under optimal conditions, to make the intended photograph can take minutes, a day, sometimes years. Or not at all. While intended photographs are sometimes lost, I believe this approach enables me to create intimate meditative photographs that evoke both a sense and transcendence of place and subject."

      "heading": "The Darkroom",
      "text": "The exposed photograph is just the first half of the creative journey. Whether exposed to grain or pixel, the goal is to articulate the composition into a meticulously crafted and considered photographic print. A new process begins, exploring variations in color and tonal balance, contrast, and emphasis, each iteration informing the whole of the completed work."

      "text": "My intention in the final print is two-fold: to convey the veracity of the original composition while invoking a sense of wonder beyond the composition's physical elements. While the print is the culmination of my effort, it is only successful if my effort is transparent to the viewer."
