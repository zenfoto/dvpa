  "intro": "Over the course of my photographic life, no place has had greater influence or offered essential sanctuary than Zion National Park. The love I have for this extraordinary place is akin to the love of a child or partner. Early images of “grand landscape” evolved into more subtle and intimate subject matter. I came to comprehend, appreciate, and celebrate the essential details that comprised the whole. Those details, whether water, tree, or stone are so varied and provide me with such joy, I know I could spend a lifetime exploring Zion and not exhaust their power.",
