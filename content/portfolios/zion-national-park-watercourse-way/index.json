  "intro": "A morning ritual of mine is to stroll stretches of Zion's Virgin River, attentively observing the rising sun’s light illuminate the western side of the canyon, painting reflected magic in the cascades and ripples of the river. No year or season is ever the same. The dynamics are constant, the river coursing new paths and fluctuating flow rates revealing new patterns and possibilities. Over time I became attenuated to the more atmospheric and abstract nature of light and water flow. The images here reflect my ever-deepening understanding of this phenomenom. I can’t help but have gratitude for the lessons I’ve been taught by such aesthetic masters.",
