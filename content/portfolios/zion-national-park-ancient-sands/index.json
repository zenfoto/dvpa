  "intro": "For years now, I've wandered the lesser traveled zones of Zion deepening my understanding and appreciation of the myriad of ways sandstone expresses itself. So often, an exceptional composition of texture and form reveals itself on a micro level teasing an imagined but physically impossible photograph. I store the experience in memory and hope a future exploration might yield a similar, larger articulation. Occasionally perseverance is rewarded; a delightful discovery of near equal texture and form physically large enough to manage a photographic composition."
