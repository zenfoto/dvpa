  "intro": "I can trace the seeds of interest in agricultural structures back to 2009 when, living in Northern California, I made many road trips down Hwy 101 to visit my mother living in Santa Barbara. Between the towns of Salinas and Paso Robles lies an agricultural belt known as the Salinas Valley. The valley specializes in produce agriculture and the western slopes are home to the Santa Lucia Highlands wine appellation, an excellent producer of Pinot Noir. My excursions inevitably veered onto side roads where my eye was quickly drawn to a kaleidoscope of geometric shapes and intersections carved into the fertile land. My camera soon accompanied me on those trips."
