  "intro": "The poetry of color and light that is Fall has long been synonymous, for me, with Zion National Park. Despite its desert environment, Zion, in concentrated pockets, can exhibit extraordinary displays of fall color. Sheltered alcoves and benches near water with significant shade offer the best environment for Maples, Oaks, Aspen, and Cottonwoods to thrive. Alas, crowds, drought, and rockfalls have had such an adverse impact on the park, I’ve begun to explore new areas including the reverent aspen groves of Colorado for fall photography.",
